    This file is only to be used for type checks performed by the text editor.
    It is named jsconfig.json rather than tsconfig.json to prevent thoughtless plain tsc runs.
    Use npm run typecheck for correct typechecking instead.

    Despite the fact the config file for JS is extended here,
    the ./typings/tsconfig.json file is used by VS Code in ./typings.

    However, tsc ignores config files in subdirectories, so two separate tsc runs are required
    if a strict check of files in ./typings (and possibly other TypeScript files) is desired.
